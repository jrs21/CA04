This is assignment CA04 where we are implementing various models to the census data. The models utilized are as follows; Random Forest, ADABOOST, Gradient, and XGBoost. These models are compared by accuracy and AUC value to determine which is the best given the dataset. It is imperative that the packages in the first code block be ran so that the models can be utilized. Furthermore each model is ran through a function that graphs the accuracy of the model vs the number of estimators used. Additionally each model includes a number of hyper parameters that can be manipulated to change the output.
